after ransacking the armories of the colonies owned by NTC, you took arms to fight against the Xenomorph assault.
Though soon they turned less lethal, danger still persists, especially those that are alone, namely survivors. Which is your job to protect now.
You are all former or current employees/colonists of Ninetails but there is still some tensions after what happened.
For that CM is closer to NTC than the rest, and believes SOM and Kaizoku to be vultures on top of a stillborn colonization"}
